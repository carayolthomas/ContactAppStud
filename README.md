ContactAppStud
==============

Test Mobile (Android) 

For this application you will have 2 packages :
  - com.example.contactsappstud :
      This package contains the definition of a Contact and the MainActivity.
      For this activity I used the universal-image-loader API in order to display pictures.
  - utils :
      This package contains a generic function which allows me to retrieve a JSON file from a server.
      

You can access to all the test in this repository https://github.com/carayolthomas/ContactAppStudTest

What is not perfect : 

  - The picture which is displayed is not centered :(
  - Some bad caracters when I am dealing with French accents
